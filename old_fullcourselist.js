But, it is also the case that close relationships are also the source of some of our darkest moments. After all, romantic relationships dissolve, family members become estranged, and friendships fail. As rewarding as social relationships can be, sometimes they just plain hurt.

Then we will turn to study a large part of the recent academic literature about torture. This literature is authored both by moral philosophers and by academics in other fields, such as political theory, history and law. However, our focus, or \u201ctake\u201d on the readings, will be specifically moral-philosophical. The course has two central aims. Firstly, to bring analytical precision and rigour to the concept of torture itself: sharpening our understanding of torture as distinctive kind of act, or practice \u2013 i.e. getting clearer on what torture is; and pinning down the unique form of violation or harm that torture constitutes \u2013 i.e. understanding how, why and to what extent, torture is a form of harm, violation or wrongdoing. Secondly, we will use the literature on this topic as a lens through which to see clearly the influence of some important moral theories \u2013 their assumptions, methods and approaches \u2013 on contemporary thinking about torture, both within moral philosophy and in the wider intellectual sphere. This will be achieved through close critical analysis of some characteristic lines of response to perhaps the most pressing question about torture that we have faced in recent years: Is interrogational torture ever morally permissible? I hope that the course will allows students to clarify and refine their own understanding of, and perspective on, torture in the world today, and to gain a sense of the lay of the land in contemporary moral philosophy, so that they can locate their perspective within the discipline"}, {"code": "PHIL 21301", "title": "Moral Theory", "notes": null, "credit": "100", "department": "Philosophy", "terms_offered": "Not offered in 2011-12", "prereq_text": "One course in ethics or moral philosophy", "desc": "Twentieth century Anglophone philosophy took a decisive turn with the development of distinctively analytic approaches to philosophical issues. This turn had a profound impact on moral philosophy. The study of thought, logic, language, and the like was intended to carry forward a study of reason as it took shape in the work of Immanuel Kant. Such efforts coincided nicely with philosophical work on knowledge and objects of knowledge, on facts, and so on\u2014topics belonging to so-called theoretical reason. Ethics, however, was somehow about value. How could that subject belong to a study of reason? In what sense was ethics objective rather than subjective? More generally, given widespread dissatisfaction with going accounts of practical (rather than theoretical) reason, what was the connection between reason and morality? The problem was made especially acute by three aspects of distinctively moral philosophy carried forward under the new analytical regime: (1) An account of morality that had it that morality (a) concerned action, and (b) involved a kind of reason for acting that enjoined agents directly, rather than via their goals, plans, projects, tastes, interests or other personal qualities; (2) An insistence that practical philosophy was accountable to its own &quot;first-order,&quot; that is that a moral theory that could not show what was wrong with slavery, say, or torture or rape or murder was, for that very reason, unsound; and (3) Stalwart adherence to a certain methodological individualism in ethics, even among those philosophers in search of a (more or less) systematic, analytical practical philosophy\u2014by these lights, showing what is wrong with, say, torture or slavery requires showing how there are good reasons to refrain from engaging in such activities, reasons that are accessible to any mature human being in possession of her or his powers who has her or his wits about him. The first and second aspects look promising for analytical ethics. The focus on morality in particular, rather than on more general questions about how one should live, looked to undercut the apparent subjective taint of work on value and action. The focus on reasons likewise looked to draw philosophers toward publicly accessible aspects of their topics, because it isn't at all clear that any strictly subjective consideration could ever serve as a reason for acting or for belief. Reasons are inherently communicable and open to public assessment. The third aspect, however\u2014an aspect that seems to belong to any study of matters pertaining to intentional action (for reasons we'll discuss)\u2014looks to force a distinctively &quot;subjective&quot; focus onto moral theory. We will examine a series of philosophical forays into the perilous terrain of making room for moral philosophy in the larger, analytically-inflected field of work on thought, knowledge, and, more generally, reason, in light of these three aspects of moral philosophy.

But the study of history and of distant communities appears to show that we may be separated by a much deeper sort of gulf: we may inhabit different conceptual schemes. What one person regards as true (or false) may be simply unintelligible to the other person; the two persons may reason according to different norms; they may see facts and be responsive to values that are simply invisible to the other; in the most radical cases, they seem to live in different worlds. According to some thinkers, the recognition of this sort of conceptual distance leads inevitably into conceptual relativism. Truth and correctness, they argue, is possible only within a given conceptual scheme. The constitutive norms of each conceptual scheme define what counts as \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201ccorrect\u201d within the framework; but the choice between different schemes is beyond the reach of rational assessment. The adoption of a new conceptual scheme is, rationally speaking, a leap into the void: it can be induced and achieved by means of \u201cpersuasion\u201d and \u201cconversion\u201d (conceived as a-rational processes), but cannot be the result of a rational discussion. However, there are strong reasons to resist this form of relativism. Is there a way to do full justice to the phenomenon of conceptual change and conceptual distance, without falling into conceptual relativism? This is the guiding question of this class. In the first part of the course, we will discuss some examples of conceptual change taken from the history of the natural sciences (T. Kuhn), anthropology (P. Winch), the history of the human sciences (I. Hacking), and the history of psychiatry (A. Davidson). In the second part of the course, we will discuss a defense of conceptual relativism (R. Rorty). In the third and last part, we will examine the views of a number of contemporary philosophers who seek to resist conceptual relativism while doing full justice to the radical character of conceptual change (S.

The first part of this course will study major theories of emotion, asking about the relationship between emotion and cognition, focusing on philosophical accounts, but also learning from anthropology and psychology.

Do the rights we enshrine as human mark only some of us (e.g., men) as human?"}, {"code": "HIST 29302", "title": "Human Rights II: History and Theory", "notes": null, "credit": "100", "department": "History", "terms_offered": "Winter", "prereq_text": null, "desc": "This course is concerned with the history and theory of the modern human rights regime. We will start with the present conundrum of human rights: a surfeit of human rights law, nationally and internationally, and an actual lack of rights for individuals and people; the proliferation of humanitarian activism and the suspicion that it will not alleviate misery and provide succor. The discussion of the present will lead us to wonder when, where, and for whom human rights and, for that matter, humanitarianism provide actual solutions to real-life problems \u2013 and what these problems might be. We will also explore the passions that motivated people to pursue human rights and the empathy that led them to uproot injustice \u2013 and what this passion did and did not achieve. The revolutionary challenges to national and international society in the late eighteenth and in the mid twentieth century will be the two pivots of this inquiry. But we will also spend a good deal of time wondering about the curious absence of human rights and in the midst of the proliferation of humanitarian good will in moments of imperialism. This, in turn, will gives us plenty of material to return to the present and to come to some informed conclusions, where we stand today in terms of human rights"}, {"code": "HIST 29303", "title": "Human Rights III: Contemporary Issues in Human Rights", "notes": null, "credit": "100", "department": "History", "terms_offered": "Spring", "prereq_text": null, "desc": "For U.S. students, the study of international human rights is becoming increasingly important, as interest grows regarding questions of justice around the globe.

The current range of views is very different from those held by the various audiences for photographs and films in the last century and the century before.

Charles Dickens\u2019s Bleak House (1852-3), set in mid-Victorian London, explores many of the same apparent divides by focusing on London\u2019s internal others: the slums that surround and threaten its legal and domestic centers, the alien inhabitants at the metropolitan heart.

Beyond addressing science thematically, how does literature respond formally, for example reimagining structures such as \u201ccharacter\u201d or genres such as the bildungsroman in light of biological and psychological explanations of how humans think, reason, and develop?
